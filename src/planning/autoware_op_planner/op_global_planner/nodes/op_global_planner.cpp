/**
 * @brief global Planner represents the Global planning Module, to generate global plan (reference path) the nodes takes start position, goal position and return sequence of waypoints.
 * @brief Once the node starts (depending on the mapping option) it will load the vector map (road network) and send it to be visualized by RViz. topic name "/vector_map_center_lines_rviz"
 * @param Start_Position in simulation environment like rviz, this node require the user to select start position using "2D Pose Estimate" button and select starting position from the global path, //
 * if localization node is working and ndt_pose or curr_pose messages are published the node will use localization as starting position instead of "2D Pose Estimate"
 * @param Goal_Position destination to generate global plan to. if "replan" option selection used can choose multiple goal positions. goal positions are selected from Rviz using "2D Nav Goal" button.
 * @return global , reference path as list of waypoints. data type is "autoware_msgs::LaneArray" , and the topic name is "lane_waypoints_array"
