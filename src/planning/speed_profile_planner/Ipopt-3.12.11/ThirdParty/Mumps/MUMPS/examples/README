* Supposing the MUMPS libraries with appropriate arithmetic have been
generated, you may compile the example drivers by typing either

   make (which defaults to make d)
   make s
   make d
   make c
   make z
or make all


* For the small Fortran driver, see comments in simpletest.F and try for example
    "mpirun -np 2 ./ssimpletest < input_simpletest_real"
    "mpirun -np 2 ./dsimpletest < input_simpletest_real"
    "mpirun -np 2 ./csimpletest < input_simpletest_cmplx"
    "mpirun -np 2 ./zsimpletest < input_simpletest_cmplx"
  if you are using the parallel version of MUMPS, or

    "./ssimpletest < input_simpletest_real"
    "./dsimpletest < input_simpletest_real"
    "./csimpletest < input_simpletest_cmplx"
    "./zsimpletest < input_simpletest_cmplx"

  if you are using the sequential version.

  The solution should be (1,2,3,4,5)


* For the small C driver, only an example using double arithmetic is available.
  Try for example
    "mpirun -np 3 ./c_example" (parallel version),or
    "./c_example" (sequential version).
  The solution should be (1,2)
