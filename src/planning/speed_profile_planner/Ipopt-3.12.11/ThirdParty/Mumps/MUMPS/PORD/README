ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:

This directory contains an implementation of the PORD algorithm,
as described in:
     "Towards a tighter coupling of bottom-up and top-down sparse
      matrix ordering methods, J. Schulze, BIT, 41:4, pp 800, 2001."

It is extracted from the SPACE-1.0 package developed at the
University of Paderborn by Juergen Schulze (js@juergenschulze.de).
A lot of the code in SPACE-1.0 was itself based on the SPOOLES
package by Cleve Ashcraft.

We are grateful to Juergen Schulze for letting us distribute PORD.
