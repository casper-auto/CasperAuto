Just like IPOPT, the sIPOPT code is separated into a library
"libsipopt" that holds the main algorithm, and an executable that acts
as a solver for AMPL. By default, the library is installed in the same
directory as libipopt, and the executable is installed in the same
directory as IPOPT's ampl executable.

The sIPOPT code has only been compiled and tested on Linux
machines. Any experience with building and running the code on other
systems is greatly appreciated. 

If you have compiled IPOPT successfully, building sIPOPT should be no
problem either. sIPOPT links to the IPOPT library, so you should
compile that first. If you want to make use of the AMPL options that
are specific to sIPOPT, you need to configure with the option 

ADD_CPPFLAGS="-DENABLE_RUN_MPC"

After successful compilation of IPOPT, change into the directory
IPOPT_BUILD_DIR/Ipopt/contrib/sIPOPT and run 

make && make install

This should take care of everything. 

Please report any problems in building or running the code to Hans
Pirnay ( hans.pirnay@rwth-aachen.de ) or the IPOPT mailing list.
