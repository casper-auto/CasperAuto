This directory and its subdirectories contain a Java interface for Ipopt. 

It was written and contributed by

  Rafael de Pelegrini Soares
  VRTech Industrial Technologies   (http://www.vrtech.com.br)
  
and later updated by

  Tong Kewei
  Beihang University   (http://www.buaa.edu.cn)

-----------

You can find more information on installing and using this interface
in the Ipopt documentation.
In the best cases, it is sufficient to run 'make' after Ipopt has been
installed successfully.

With 'make test' you can run two example problems.

With 'make doc' you can generate javadoc help.

-----------

Usage:

If you want to use Ipopt from Java, all you need to include is the
org/coinor/Ipopt.class file.  At runtime, there must be the
lib/libjipopt.so file.

Comments by Tong Kewei (2007-11-11):
This is a revised version of JNI of C++ interface of IPOPT.
I changed from Rafael de Pelegrini Soares's original code.
His codes are originally derived form C version of IPOPT,which has limited functions. 
I derived my codes from C++ version of IPOPT, which is much more powerful.  
I also fix a bug in Rafael de Pelegrini Soares's code on function setProblemScaling,
In his original code the function setProblemScaling has no use to change problem.
I added some useful functions in JIpopt, such as get_scaling_parameters or get_number_of_nonlinear_variables
or get_list_of_nonlinear_variables. You can add any more functions as you like. Follow my structure it is 
very easy.
 
If you have problem or you need me to add another functions, please contact me.
