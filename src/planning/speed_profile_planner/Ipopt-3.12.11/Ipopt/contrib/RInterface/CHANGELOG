09 March 2012, version 0.8.4:

    * Included additional variables to the object that is returned from ipoptr (thanks to Michael Schedl). These are:
            z_L         : final values for the lower bound multipliers
            z_U         : final values for the upper bound multipliers
            constraints : final values for the constraints
            lambda      : final values for the Lagrange mulipliers
      After solving the NLP using
            R> res <- ipoptr( ... )
      They can be accessed using
            R> res$z_L
            R> res$z_U
            R> res$constraints
            R> res$lambda

    * Removed ipoptr_environment as argument in ipoptr because it wasn't useful and it caused undesired behaviour in 
      combination with the data.table package (thanks to Florian Oswald for reporting).
      
20 November 2011, version 0.8.3:

	* Added #include <assert.h> to src/IpoptRNLP.hpp
