This file lists a few website where more AMPL models can be
downloaded.  Not all of those problems are small enough to be used
with the AMPL student version.

Bob Vanderbei's collection:

  This incluhes the complete Hock-Schittkowski suite:

The COPS test problems:

  The default sizes are too large for the AMPL Student Solver version.
  However, in many cases you can reduce the problem size by editing
  the *.par1 parameter data files.


Some nice engineering examples implemented by Dieter Kraft

  Look the the "Research" section, there are links to four AMPL models
  (some with separate data files).


If you know of more interesting example models, please send a message
to the Ipopt mailing list and an entry will be added here.
